/* MANARA («منارة») — multi-hazard simulation engine  →  window.ManaraSim
 * ==========================================================================================
 * Pure, seeded, deterministic. No DOM, no network, no libraries, no hidden global state (the only module-level cache is the
 * immutable world, built once). A classic script: it works from file:// and in Node (load it with `vm`):
 *     const ctx = vm.createContext({}); vm.runInContext(fs.readFileSync('site/manara/js/sim.js','utf8'), ctx); const S = ctx.ManaraSim;
 * It attaches to globalThis / self / window. Everything the pages show from it is a SIMULATION ("SIM"): a mechanism check of the
 * pipeline Sense → Prove → Reach → Guide → Count → Hand off, NOT proof of real-world impact. Every tunable number is a named
 * assumption (ManaraSim.PARAMS, 100+ of them, each with a default, range, unit, plain bilingual description and source).
 *
 * QUICK START
 *   const sim = S.create({ preset: 'fire-night', mode: 'manara', seed: 7 });   // mode: 'manara' | 'ordinary'
 *   S.step(sim, dt);                 // advance dt real seconds (fixed 1 s ticks inside; a remainder is kept) — call from rAF with dt*speed
 *   const snap = S.snapshot(sim);    // plain JSON: draw the map, the people, the log, the dispatch card ...
 *   S.approve(sim);                  // the human key (only needed when create({autoApprove:false}))
 *   const r = S.ab({ preset: 'fire-night', seed: 7 });   // same seed, ordinary alarm vs MANARA → comparable metrics (+ deltas)
 *
 * UNITS & CONVENTIONS
 *   Grid 96 × 64 cells, 1 cell = 5 m, north-up, x east, y south. Positions are in cell units (floats; cell centres at +0.5).
 *   Time: sim.t = seconds since the run began (integer ticks); sim.hour0 = clock hour at t = 0 (e.g. 4 = 04:00); snapshot.clock = 'HH:MM:SS'.
 *   Text is always {ar, en}. Wind: deg = the direction the wind blows FROM (315 = north-westerly), speed in m/s.
 *   Indoor positions use floor-plan coordinates inside the building footprint; person.fl = floor index (0 ground, 3 = roof).
 *   Rooms are numbered by floor: 1xx ground, 2xx first, 3xx second (Ravi 203, Huda 105, Abu Salem 302, Lina 106 / class 5B).
 *
 * WORLD  (ManaraSim.worldInfo() → static JSON; the same world every run)
 *   A Doha-style block: workers' residence 'RB' (3 floors: rooms 101–110 / 201–210 / 301–310 along a corridor, Stair A (west), Stair B
 *   (east), roof door (on Stair B), refuge balcony, lobby + guard desk, entrance; no lift — an assumption), school 'SCH' (2 floors,
 *   8 classes, yard assembly), construction site with cooling container, mosque, shops (drone dock on the roof), souq, LPG store and
 *   gas line, a park, a road underpass (lowest ground: floods first), six assembly points, a road graph (major/minor/expressway/access
 *   roads, 39 segments) and FICTIONAL responders at the map edge or beyond it: Civil Defence Station A (fire + rescue), Rescue & HazMat
 *   Station B (fire + rescue + hazmat), Police posts 1–2, Ambulance point + Nakheel Hospital ambulance, Nakheel Hospital (ED), Emergency
 *   Trauma Centre (ED + trauma). All demo names say "(demo)". ~120 registered residents (incl. Ravi, Huda, Abu Salem, Lina), 160 pupils,
 *   teachers, staff, a guard, shop workers, passers-by, trained volunteers. The language mix is an illustrative demo mix, not demography.
 *
 * ManaraSim.create(opts) → sim          (opts all optional)
 *   preset      'fire-night' (default, 04:00) | 'gas-night' | 'flood-day' | 'dust-day' | 'heat-day' | 'sos-day' | 'school-fire-day'
 *               ManaraSim.PRESETS[id] = { hazard, hour, tIgnite, durationSec, wind, name:{ar,en}, blurb:{ar,en}, incident:{ar,en}, scope }
 *               ManaraSim.PRESET_ORDER lists them in menu order.
 *   mode        'manara' (default) | 'ordinary' — the "ordinary alarm": one siren where such a detector exists (fire, gas), Arabic+English
 *               announcements only, everybody heads for the nearest exit/shelter on a STATIC map (nobody knows the roof door is locked or the
 *               road is flooded; people only see flames / deep water locally and find a locked exit by walking into it), no personal alert, no
 *               routing, no headcount (unless the assumption `rollCall` = 1), 999 is called when a person notices (assumption).
 *   seed        uint32 (default 1). Hashed randoms are stateless, so the SAME seed gives the SAME physics and the SAME personal draws in both
 *               modes (common random numbers → a fair A/B).
 *   params      { key: value } overrides of ManaraSim.PARAMS (see below).     hour: start clock hour.    wind: {deg, speed}.
 *   autoApprove false → a real operator must call approve(); default true (a simulated operator approves `approveSec` after CONFIRMED).
 *   tIgnite     seconds until the hazard starts (default per preset; use a huge value to wait for ManaraSim.trigger()).   durationSec: run length.
 *   gasType     'lpg' (default) | 'h2s' | 'co' — sets danger levels (S46–S48) and heavier-than-air pooling for the gas hazard.
 *
 * STEPPING
 *   ManaraSim.step(sim, dt=1) → ticks run     ManaraSim.run(sim, untilSec?) → sim (default: to durationSec)    sim.done is true at the end.
 *   ManaraSim.restart(sim, overrides?) → a fresh sim with the same options.   ManaraSim.hash(sim) → 8-hex FNV hash of the full snapshot.
 *
 * SIM FIELDS (read-only; documented because the tests and Mission Control read them)
 *   sim.t, sim.hour0, sim.mode, sim.preset, sim.hazard, sim.seed, sim.P (resolved assumptions), sim.wind, sim.done,
 *   sim.ver   { phase:'idle'|'suspect'|'confirmed'|'public', suspectAt, confirmedAt, approvedAt, publicAt, zone, needsApproval, keys:{key:true} }
 *   sim.local { on, at, kind:'siren', struct, pos, radiusM }   the building / store alarm (fire & gas); it never waits for any key
 *   sim.alert null | { id, level:'evacuate'|'shelter'|'watch', issuedAt, counts, recipients, instructions:[{ar,en}], byLang, byFormat }
 *   sim.exits [{ id:'E'|'A'|'B'|'R'|'M'|'W', name, state:'OPEN'|'SMOKE'|'FIRE'|'LOCKED', locked }]  (RB then SCH)
 *   sim.people [ person ]   sim.byKey[key]   sim.heroes {ravi, huda, 'abu-salem', lina → index}   sim.events [ {t,type,text:{ar,en},...} ]
 *   sim.plan   null | dispatch plan (see DISPATCH)     sim.drone   sim.traffic   sim.series (5 s samples)   sim.sensors
 *   sim.F { smoke, gas, water, dust } Float32Array(96*64)   sim.ofire Uint8Array (outdoor fire: 1 burning, 2 burnt)   — or use ManaraSim.view(sim).
 *
 * SNAPSHOT  ManaraSim.snapshot(sim, { full?, events?, lastEvents?, sensors?, series?, metrics? }) → JSON-serialisable
 *   { v, preset, hazard, mode, seed, t, clock, hour, done, label:{ar,en}, wind:{deg,speed},
 *     verification:{ phase, zone, keys[], suspectAt, confirmedAt, approvedAt, publicAt, needsApproval },
 *     localAlarm:{ on, at }, exits:[{id, struct, name, state, locked}], alert, counts:{ people, away, asleep, aware, informed, moving, safe, sheltered, down, waiting, injured },

 *     drone:{ state:'DOCKED|LAUNCH|TRANSIT|PATROL|TRACK|HOLD|YIELD|RETURN|CHARGING', x, y, battery, light:'friendly'|'off', mission, located },
 *     traffic:{ load, hour, jams, closed[], closedBy }, dispatch (see DISPATCH) | null, sensors:[…active…], hazardState:{ per hazard: burningRooms, smokeMax, peak, underpassCm, wbgt … },
 *     people:[{ id, key, role, persona, st, aware, asleep, away, x, y, fl, lang, name?, hero?, room?, cls?, deaf?, blind?, dose?, injured?, checkin?, safeKind?, ladder?, msg?, plan?, strain? }],
 *     events:[…last 60…] }
 *   person.st: idle | working | moving | waiting | sheltered | safe | down (collapsed, needs help) | incapacitated (model dose ≥ 1) | away.
 *   person.aware: 0 unaware, 1 aware (siren / own eyes / teacher — ordinary behaviour), 2 informed (personal alert: live route).
 *   ManaraSim.view(sim) → { w,h,cellM, smoke, gas, water, dust, outdoorFire, elev, kind, walk, fuel } typed arrays for canvases (do not modify).
 *   ManaraSim.person(sim, key) → one person with timings.   ManaraSim.sensors(sim) → every channel with value/active/alarm.
 *
 * EVENTS  sim.events[i] = { t, type, text:{ar,en}, ...fields } — type is one of: start, ignition, fire-spread, flashover, fire-outdoor, valve-closed, local-alarm,
 *   sentinel-buzzer, suspect, suspect-clear, confirmed, approved, rejected, public-alert, person-alert (heroes), ladder, ladder-stop, woke, knock (heroes),
 *   exit-state {exit,from,to}, exit-set, reroute {affected,of}, dead-end, trapped, safe (heroes), checkin ("help" only), injured / incapacitated, collapse, case-confirmed,
 *   drone {state}, drone-ordered, drone-located, dispatch-recommended, recommendation-change, far-but-faster, dispatch-approved, dispatched, unit-en-route,
 *   unit-on-scene, unit-cleared, reroute-unit, redispatch {kind,from,to,reason,gainSec}, road-closed {seg,by}, road-open, road-jam, unit-busy, scenario-jam,
 *   cordon, suppression, rescued, help-arrived {by}, transport, hospital-arrival, call-999 (ordinary world), threshold (WBGT), end.
 *   sim.evCount[type] counts every occurrence, including the ones too frequent to log one by one.
 *
 * OPERATOR / TEST ACTIONS (all return truthy on success; they log events)
 *   setParam(sim, key, value)  change one assumption of a running sim (clamped); returns false for parameters with PARAMS[i].live === false
 *   (population, thresholds fixed at start): those apply on restart(sim, {params:{…}}).
 *   approve(sim) | reject(sim, holdSec=120) | trigger(sim) (start the hazard now) | setExit(sim,'A'|'RB.R'|'SCH.W', {locked}) (unlock / lock)
 *   setWind(sim,{deg,speed}) | setTraffic(sim, load 0..2) | jamRoad(sim, segId, factor 0.05..1) | unjamRoad | closeRoad(sim, segId, closed=true)
 *   setUnitBusy(sim, assetId, busy=true, kind?) | setHospital(sim, id, {freeBeds}) | setHour(sim, hour)
 *   injectKey(sim, channelId, add, seconds) | injectDecoy(sim, 'vapour'|'hotmug'|'redcar', seconds)  — single-key false triggers ("Fool me if you can")
 *   checkin(sim, personKey, 'safe'|'help')   — a phone / kiosk check-in.
 *
 * PIPELINE (per hazard; the same code for all six)
 *   Sense   sensor channels with noise (sensorNoise), drift and warm-up (warmupSec), cross-sensitivity flags; a reading above its threshold
 *           for keyHoldSec = an active KEY. Fire: thermal (57 °C or 8.3 °C/min, S58) / smoke (MQ-2, baseline + 3σ) / vision (a sentinel in every room and corridor node of the building);
 *           gas: two or three gas sensors in different places + rising trend; flood: water level (15 cm) at two spots + rain gauge + weather-office feed;
 *           dust: PM10 + visibility camera + weather feed; heat: WBGT + work-hours rule (+ a collapse = a "someone needs help" case);
 *           SOS: fall detector (impact + 15 s stillness) + 30 s "no answer" to the check-in call.
 *   Prove   SUSPECT = one key. CONFIRMED = two keys of DIFFERENT independence groups in the same zone held confirmHoldSec. One key alone can
 *           never reach CONFIRMED. PUBLIC needs the human key (approve). The local alarm (building siren, store alarm, a sentinel's buzzer)
 *           never waits.
 *   Reach   issueAlert(): zones evacuate / shelter / watch / none from the hazard FORECAST; per-person language, format (sound, vibration,
 *           strobe, voice, picture card, text, pictogram), delivery via the app, the teacher's tablet (pupils), the mother's phone (Lina),
 *           the zone broadcast (passers-by, assumption), smart exit signs (people without the app). Night wake-up ladder: T+0 sound+vibration
 *           (+strobe), +30 s louder + light, +60 s the guard is sent a priority list and knocks doors, +90 s Civil Defence gets the list;
 *           it stops per person when they wake/confirm (person.ladderLog, ladderStopAt).
 *   Guide   multi-source Dijkstra from the safe targets of THIS hazard over indoor graphs + the grid, avoiding danger (smoke / plume / water,
 *           with a look-ahead forecast), respecting exit states (a LOCKED / FIRE exit is removed, a SMOKE exit costs more), persona
 *           constraints (no stairs for wheelchair users → refuge balcony), recomputed every 4 s and at once when an exit changes. Only the people
 *           whose route changed get a new message (event 'reroute' {affected, of}). People at an assembly point that becomes unsafe are re-sent.
 *   Count   "I'm safe" / "I need help" / unaccounted against the register; rooms prioritised (needs, then closeness to the danger).
 *           ManaraSim.headcount(sim) → { registered, safe, safeAway, help, unaccounted, rooms:{room:{total,safe,help,unaccounted}},
 *           unaccountedList:[{key,name,room,lang,needs[],score,asleep,last}], helpList }.
 *   Hand off  ManaraSim.handoff(sim, {top?, cap?}) → the Civil Defence / ambulance card data; ManaraSim.cap(sim, {languages:['ar','en'], date, tz})
 *           → an OASIS CAP 1.2 XML string, status "Exercise", one <info> per language (non-ar/en languages are marked DRAFT).
 *
 * HAZARD MODELS (all parameters are labelled assumptions unless a source is named)
 *   FIRE   Cellular automaton in the published Alexandridis et al. (2008) form: p_burn = p_h (1 + p_veg)(1 + p_den) p_w p_s with wind factor
 *          p_w = exp(c1 V) exp(c2 V (cos θ − 1)), c1 = 0.045, c2 = 0.131, p_h = 0.58, slope factor exp(a θ_s), a = 0.078. Source: Alexandridis A.,
 *          Vakalis D., Siettos C.I., Bafas G.V., Appl. Math. Comput. 204 (2008) 191–201; parameter values as tabulated in Russo L., Russo P.,
 *          Vakalis D., Siettos C., Chem. Eng. Trans. 36 (2014) 253–258, DOI 10.3303/CET1436043 (checked on that paper). Indoors the same rule runs
 *          on the room graph (V = indoor draught, θ = angle to it; door factors, flashover time (S5) and smoke exchange are named assumptions).
 *          Outdoors: 5 m cells, real wind, fuel types (shrubs, parked cars, building materials); smoke = a field advected downwind.
 *   GAS    Concentration field from a leak point: advection by the wind + diffusion; heavier-than-air gases creep downhill and pool (the
 *          underpass, the park basin); seeps indoors with a lag. Levels (ppm, docs/MANARA-HAZARDS.md §13): propane warn 1000 / danger 2100 = 10 %LEL (S48), CO 35 / 200 (S46), H2S 10 / 20 (S47).
 *   FLOOD  Rising water depth over a height map (the underpass fills first); thresholds for walking and for closing roads; storm compressed in time (SIM).
 *   DUST   PM10 front advancing with the wind (lead time before arrival); outdoors people exposed, indoors reduced; warn 150 µg/m³ (S31), danger 255, critical 425 (S49).
 *   HEAT   WBGT ramp (SIM) vs. stop-all-work 32.1 °C (S19); per-worker strain accumulates with exposure, recovers in cooled shelters; collapse → SOS case.
 *   SOS    A person collapses; time-to-help = the first of: trained volunteer on foot, drone with an AED (authority-operated), ambulance.
 *   Exposure "dose" thresholds, wake-up probabilities, reaction times and speeds are assumptions, not medical or measured values; the engine never
 *   reports deaths — only "injured / unable to move in the model".
 *
 * DRONE  docked → launches on CONFIRMED (+droneLaunchSec; for SOS after approval) → stand-off point → PATROL → TRACK → HOLD (outside view,
 *   thermal search finds people on balconies / roof / outdoors) → YIELD when a fire engine is on scene → RETURN → CHARGING. Friendly light
 *   (steady green + two white flashes). Battery endurance is derated above 40 °C (assumption). A concept operated by the authority.
 *
 * DISPATCH — the fastest unit given traffic, not the nearest by distance   (see docs/MANARA-SPEC.md "Nearest-responder dispatch")
 *   Road graph with time-varying simulated traffic: segment time = length / (free-flow speed × emergencyFactor × congestion);
 *   congestion = 1 − (1 − dailyProfile(hour)) × classSensitivity × load, × hot-spot dips (the school road at drop-off 06:45–07:45 and pick-up
 *   12:30–13:30, junction queues, road works), × operator jams, × incident slow-down; closed roads (flood, fire/smoke, gas plume, operator) are removed.
 *   Required units per hazard: fire → fire + ambulance + police (+ rescue for the residence); gas → hazmat fire + ambulance + police;
 *   flood → rescue + police + ambulance; dust → police + ambulance; heat / SOS → ambulance (+ the destination hospital).
 *   For each kind: time-dependent Dijkstra from every candidate unit, skip busy / incapable / cut-off units, take the minimum ETA (turn-out +
 *   drive), keep the runner-up and the distance for the "why this unit" line. Hospital: nearest that has the needed capability (flags ed = 24 h emergency, trauma = Level I, paed = paediatric; patients need 'ed' | 'trauma' | 'paed')
 *   and free capacity (beds × (1 − occupancy), an assumption). States: recommended → approved → dispatched → en-route → on-scene → cleared.
 *   ETA is recomputed every second; en-route units re-route around new jams / closures; a busy unit, a closed road or a faster alternative
 *   (≥ redispatchMarginSec) triggers an automatic 'redispatch' event. Arrival effects (named assumptions): fire engine on scene (+engineSetupSec)
 *   cuts fire spread by engineEffectPct and extinguishes later; hazmat on scene closes the gas valve 90 s later; rescue brings out people who
 *   cannot move after rescueAssistSec; ambulance ends the SOS wait; police set up a cordon (no more arrivals at the flooded underpass).
 *   In the ordinary world 999 is called after ordinaryCallSec (or a person collapses + ordinaryNoticeSec) and the SAME selection rule runs;
 *   only the timing differs. Scenes: residence 'BLD', school 'SCH', gas store 'LPGN', underpass 'M1', district 'M2', worksite 'SITE', park 'PARK'.
 *   sim.plan / snapshot.dispatch = { id, state, origin:'manara'|'ordinary', hazard, scene:{node,x,y}, t:{recommended,approved,dispatched,en-route,on-scene,cleared},
 *     patients:{n,need}, units:[{ kind:'fire'|'rescue'|'ambulance'|'police', assetId, name:{ar,en}, state, etaSec, etaMin, distM, pos:{x,y}, route:[[x,y]…],
 *       why:{ar,en}, whyData:{ chosen, runnerUp, nearestByDistance, farButFaster, gainSec, extraDistM, slow, skippedBusy, cutOff }, runnerUp, reroutes, replaced }],
 *     hospital:{ id, name, etaSec, etaMin, distM, freeBeds, fits, why, options } | null }
 *   ManaraSim.busDispatch(sim) → the bus message { type:'dispatch', id, units:[{kind, name, etaMin, status, why}], hospital:{name, etaMin}|null }.
 *   ManaraSim.traffic = { makeRoadGraph, roadTravel, roadDistance, pickUnit, congestion, segFactors, profileAt, ROAD_CLASS, PROFILE, snapshot(sim), pickHospital(sim, {n,need}) }
 *     — pure helpers for hand-built graphs (the tests use them) and for drawing the congestion of every road.
 *   ManaraSim.residentLines(sim) → calm lines for the phones [{kind, state, etaMin?, text:{ar,en}}] e.g. "Fire engine ETA 4 min", "Ambulance ETA 6 min — stay where you are".
 *   ManaraSim.dispatchCompare(sim, kind, {hour, load}) → fastest vs nearest-by-distance (and whether it is "farther but faster").
 *
 * MODEL  ManaraSim.model = { alexWind(V, cosθ, c1, c2), alexBurn(P, p_veg, p_den, V, cosθ, slopeDeg) } — the published formula as code (explain-it box, tests).
 *
 * BUS HELPERS (docs/MANARA.md)  busAlert(sim, personKey) → { type:'alert', id, level, hazard, area, at:{x,y}, fire?:{x,y}, radiusM, wind, you, distanceM,
 *   bearingDeg, safe:{x,y,name}, route:[[x,y]…], etaMin, instructions[], lang, formats[], action, persona };  compose(sim, personKey) → the
 *   per-person message { level, action, lang, draftTranslation, formats, text };  routeCheck(sim, personKey) → safety audit of a live route.
 *
 * METRICS & A/B (always labelled SIM)  ManaraSim.metrics(sim) → { timeToLocalAlarmSec, timeToFirstAlertSec, timeToFirstPersonalAlertSec,
 *   timeToConfirmedSec, timeToApprovalSec, alertedPctAt60/120/300, informedPctAt60/120/300, timeToSafe:{n,p50,p90,max,censored,reliable},
 *   stillNotSafe:{t60,t120,t300,t600}, exposed, injuredInModel, incapacitatedInModel, exposurePersonSec, enteredDanger, deadEnds, collapses,
 *   timeToHelp:{n,of,p50,max,by[]}, headcount:{registered, atT:{t60..}, final}|null, timeTo90pctAccountedSec, dispatch:{timeToDispatchSec,
 *   timeToOnSceneSec, units[]}, reroutesNotified, droneLocated, headline:{key,value,unit,label} }.
 *   People who never reach safety are counted at the end of the run (censored, never ignored); timeToSafe.reliable is false when most
 *   people never needed to move, and the deltas then omit it.
 *   ManaraSim.ab({preset, seed, params, seconds, hour, wind}) → { label, preset, seed, params, ordinary:metrics, manara:metrics, delta, hash }
 *   (delta: positive = MANARA better, except firstAlertSec where positive = the ordinary alarm came earlier — an honest trade-off).
 *   ManaraSim.sweep({preset, param, values, seeds:[1,2], seconds}) → rows { value, headlineOrdinary, headlineManara, headlineGap, ... } — how the gap
 *   depends on ONE assumption. Always show it: the result depends on assumptions.
 *
 * LIMITATIONS (say them out loud)  Simple physics, not CFD; people are point agents without pushing/queuing beyond a crowding slow-down; no lift;
 *   no explosion model; the demo population, traffic profile and responder stations are fictional; hospital capacity and unit availability are
 *   assumptions; the flood/dust/heat/gas inputs are scenario inputs (SIM); the A/B depends on the named assumptions and is not an
 *   effectiveness claim. In real life 999 stays the dispatcher; MANARA sends a verified package and never replaces national systems.
